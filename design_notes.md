# Design Notes
## Checklist Class
   - Simple ToDo list - items sorted vertically
   - Unsorted
   - Basic Functions:
      - Create + Name
      - Add item
      - Remove item
      - View list
      - Delete list
   - Advanced Functions:
      - Save list
      - Check items off without removing them
      - Check/Uncheck all items at once
      - Show checked/unchecked items visually
      - Sort list by checked/unchecked

## Inventory Class
   - Key/Value list
   - Sorted
   - Unique keys, non-unique values
   - _Examples_:
      - Character Sheet (for games like D&D)
      - !Things! Owned list / Inventory list
         - Books by author (titles would need to be unique)
         - Movies by genre
         - Items with numbers associated with them
   - Notes:
      - May use a built-in data struct for basic inventory and create a class for character sheets
      - data class - built-in data struct class helper, takes care of the weird stuff
      - dict would work also
   - Key : Value
      - Movie Title : Genre
      - Book Title  : Author
      - Item        : Quantity

---
## Categorical Class
   - List of Lists
   - Like a set of Folders with items inside
   - Sorted? by Category
   - Moving items from Category to Category would mean removing them from one sublist and adding to another
   - _Examples_:
      - Kanban Board / Project Plan
      - Shopping list by grocery department
      - Tasks by day/week/month
